# VideoCompilationPage

A simple HTML website I built to showcase some popular cat YouTube videos.

## Features
-Three main categories for different meme cats: Keyboard Cat, Nyan Cat and Grumpy Cat.
-For each cat an embedded YouTube video is included.
-Each video has clear headings and descriptions.

## What I Learned
-How to structure a webpage with semantic HTML('<main>','<section>','<h1>','<h2>').
-How to use '<iframe>' to embed YouTube videos and set titles for sake of accessibility.
-How to oranize content for clarity and simple browsing.
